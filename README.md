## Status
`mlr3keras` is in very early stages of development, and currently only partially under development.

 Comments, discussion and issues/bug reports and PR's are **highly** appreciated.
 
 If you want to **contribute**, please propose / discuss adding functionality in an issue in order to avoid unneccessary or duplicate work.

## Design

This package's purpose for now is to understand the design-decisions required to make `keras` \ `tensorflow` work
with `mlr3` **and** flexible enough for users.

Several design decisions are not made yet, so input is highly apreciated.
