# mlr3keras 0.1.2

## Learners
* TabNet and FeedForward can now deal with factor / ordered / logical features
* FeedForward Keras Models now default to "embeddings" for factor features

# mlr3keras 0.1.1

## General
* KerasArchitecture:
  Introduced new abstraction for architectures.
  This should rarely be visible to users but makes stuff easier to extend.

## Learners
* Add regression learner for a custom model
* Add regression learner for parametrized feedforward model
* Add stacked and unstacked tabnet classification and regression learner


# mlr3keras 0.1.0

* Initial prototype.
