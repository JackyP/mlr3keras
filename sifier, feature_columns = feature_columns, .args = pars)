_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     An alternative interface for ‘do.call()’, similar to the
     deprecated function in ‘purrr’. This function tries hard to not
     evaluate the passed arguments too eagerly which is important when
     working with large R objects.

     It is recommended to pass all arguments named in order to to not
     rely on on positional argument matching.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     invoke(.f, ..., .args = list(), .opts = list(), .seed = NA_integer_)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

      .f: :: function()
          Function to call.

     ...: :: ‘any’
          Additional function arguments passed to ‘.f’.

   .args: :: ‘list()’
          Additional function arguments passed to ‘.f’, as (named)
          ‘list()’. These arguments will be concatenated to the
          arguments provided via ‘...’.

   .opts: :: ‘list()’
          List of options which are set before the ‘.f’ is called.
          Options are reset to their previous state afterwards.

   .seed: :: ‘integer(1)’
          Random seed to set before invoking the function call. Gets
          reset to the previous seed on exit.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     invoke(mean, .args = list(x = 1:10))
     invoke(mean, na.rm = TRUE, .args = list(1:10))
